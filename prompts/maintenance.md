    ## Write a clean squawk for maintenance
    **Use when:** You need a crisp discrepancy statement.  
    **Tags:** squawk, logbook, write-up

- Relevant indications (gauge, light, smell, sound)
- Repro steps if possible
- Operational limitation recommendation (if any)

Symptom:

    ## Post-maintenance acceptance flight plan
    **Use when:** You’re doing a careful test flight after work was performed.  
    **Tags:** maintenance, test flight, acceptance

    ```text
    Act as a cautious GA test pilot (non-experimental).

Work performed: [PASTE]
Aircraft: [TYPE]
Field: [IDENT]
Weather: [VMC/IMC], winds: [PASTE]

Create an acceptance flight plan:
- Ground checks
- Taxi checks
- Takeoff and initial climb checks
- Enroute checks (step-by-step)
- Return and landing checks
Include abort criteria and “stop if…” conditions.
Keep it generic and conservative.

    ## Parts comparison notes (owner decision)
    **Use when:** You’re comparing parts/shops and want decision notes.  
    **Tags:** owner, mx, decision

    ```text
    Act as a pragmatic aircraft owner.

Options:
1) [Option A] cost [X], lead time [Y], warranty [Z]
2) [Option B] cost [X], lead time [Y], warranty [Z]
3) [Option C] ...

Create a decision matrix with:
- Safety impact
- Downtime impact
- Total cost of ownership
- Risk/unknowns
Then recommend the best option and what questions to ask before committing.
