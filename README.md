# Aviator Prompts

A practical prompt pack for general aviation pilots: flight planning, weather interpretation, comms rehearsal, training debriefs, safety/risk, and maintenance write-ups.

This repo is intentionally simple: it is primarily a **prompt library** in Markdown so you can copy/paste into ChatGPT, Gemini, or your own model.
