# Contributing

Thanks for contributing.

## Ground rules
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid new heavy dependencies unless clearly justified

## Prompt contributions
If you are adding or editing prompts:
- Keep them operational and conservative
- Use consistent formatting
- Avoid anything that could be mistaken as authoritative instruction
- Add useful tags that improve searchability

## Pull request checklist
- [ ] Prompts are accurate, conservative, and clearly written
- [ ] Prompts do not include made-up frequencies/procedures as authoritative
- [ ] Index updated (if you add new prompt files)
